Hello, my name is Akosa Mora and I am a results-driven Senior DevSecOps Engineer with a strong background in application security, extensive expertise in Kubernetes security, and comprehensive knowledge of Cloud/DevOps practices. Seeking a challenging role to lead security initiatives, implement secure architectures, and ensure the protection of critical applications and infrastructure.

I have leveraged the power of Amazon S3 to host my resume website, which is a highly scalable and secure object storage service. I have used Route 53, AWS's Domain Name System (DNS) service, to point my domain to my S3 bucket, ensuring that my website is easily accessible to anyone who visits.

To improve the performance and availability of my website, I have distributed it using CloudFront, which is a content delivery network (CDN) that delivers your website's content to users with low latency and high transfer speeds.

Finally, to ensure that my website is secure, I have used Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) to secure my website with an SSL/TLS certificate. This allows for secure communication between my website and its users and also gives me peace of mind knowing that my resume is protected.

Overall, by using these AWS services, I have been able to create a fast, secure, and highly available website for hosting my resume. I hope that this approach is helpful for those looking to host their own static website. Thank you for your time.
